# Project Information

Once the program starts, there is a screen with the game title, and 
two textboxs with "select" and "Quit" on it.

The user has to press the key "s" to go into the music difficulty
selection screen. Or press "esc" to quit the game.

The difficulty selection screen has "Easy" "Medium" and "Hard" to
let the user choose from, by pressing "1" "2" and "3"

Press left arrow key to go back to the main screen.

## Notes
Because this week's goal is to get the animation going, I didn't have
anymore key features to add, therefore, no new instructions to the players.
