# Project Information

Once the program starts, there is a screen with the game title, and 
two textboxs with "select" and "Quit" on it.

The user has to press the key "s" to go into the music difficulty
selection screen. Or press "esc" to quit the game.

The difficulty selection screen has "Easy" "Medium" and "Hard" to
let the user choose from, by pressing "1" "2" and "3"

Press left arrow key to go back to the main screen.

## Notes
This is according to my progress so far.

I cannot gurantee anymore features without further to implement.
