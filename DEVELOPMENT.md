# Development

Part1:

4/21/20:
--
Importned ImGui, but found out that it actually does not do anything significant. Start reading 
through all the cinder documentations for Gui.

4/22/20:
--
Used logic for making textbox in snake, made 3 drawings for my three main UIs, and loaded the 
songs i wanted.

4/26/20:
--
Finished drawing the frames for tiles to drop.

4/27/20:
--
Adding the Choreograph Cincer Block, reading through the documentation and trying to understand
the basic logic.

4/28/20:
--
Still reading through the documentation, found it confusing.

4/29/20:
--
Finished implementing the basic code for 1 tile, the animation doesn't not because the update()
doesn't not take in any argument, however, on the Choreograph documentation, the update() seems
able to take 1 argument (ch:Time dt). Stuck and struggling to get the animation going.

4/30/20:
--
Made the animation work, added 3 more tiles, made them drop at different speed. However, still
need to figure out how to repeat the animation. 

Because Choreograph is way more difficult than I thought it would be, I HAVE to reduce the number 
of songs to 1, with (hopefully) 2 difficulties. Or I will be extremely difficult to take care of 
all three songs.
